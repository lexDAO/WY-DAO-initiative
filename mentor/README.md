# Guidance for prospective LexDAO Mentor(s)

Welcome to a Brave new World

LexDAO appreciates you taking your valuable time in inspiring new rogues. Your role is broadly a mix of:
* 40% **Counsel** - making sure apprentices stay within the bounds of the problem brief;
* 30% **Coach** - help professional development by giving honest feedback about their performance;
* 20% **Cheer Leader** - encourage them by personal anecdotes on how you got to where you are now;

We are competing with law firms (compliance) and courts (complaints) as an alternative career path. As Ross puts it
> In law school you're taught to think big about what the law is meant to accomplish, but law firms are not paid to think. No one cares about your theories. It kills training for lawyers.  - Ross

The DAO means you can bootstrap your own mini-constitution (community) or micro-charter (commercial) which means new skills are required:
1. writing bylaws/workflow with token mechanisms to bridge between Web3 primitives and the human norms;
2. envisaging and mitigating the various resulting scenarios (bad leaver) or transaction failures (buggy code);
3. electronic dispute resolution via neutral mediation or technical self-help (problem-solving).

## Mentor-Apprentice 4wk (part-time) or 1wk (intensive)
1. Pre-reqs ... basic test of Web3 literacy (TBA how much hand-holding needed?):
* install Brave browser and get ETH pub/pri key;
* fork the github on-boarding and markdown a brief (500 word max) profile;
* install the link within LexDAO cryptovoxel entryway
2. Success means getting one LXX legal engineerng token which permission to browse the problem briefs
3. Select 1-3 prefs and chitchat with prospective mentors (via discord)
4. As soon as enough apprentices indicate interest, match mentors and schedule the program
5. Upon success, if accomplish all tasks they should gain at least 10 LXX tokens to be certified

## Expectations
Mentors are expected to:
1. Commit time (as pre-determined) for small-group discussions;
2. Be ambassador for LexDOA by being visible and active in ongoing discourse channels;
3. Optionally nominate problem briefs which are of professional interest;

## Unique Features
* Peer programming - pair up a law student with software dev to cross-train each other in the basics, encourage them to write wikis to explain the basics (self-discovery) as your role is to identity the knowledge gaps, then point to right direction, **not** be a lecturer (role of law school)
* Weekly [standup](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/standups) reviews - recorded so need to be succinct (time pressure) as well as prepared (effective use of group mentoring time);
* Peer [assessment](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/360-degree-feedback-information-1917537) - rather than grading, apprentices compare others relative to their study partner so you need to encourage them where did well or can improve.
