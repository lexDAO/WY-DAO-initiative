# BASICS
structure: Those who take initiative to do work for the mentor-apprentce riad can decide how they do that work. If any LexDOA members hold serious concerns, they can start a proposal to halt what someone is doing.
mission: To initiate a legal engineering alternative to law firm internship or judge chamber clerkship
values: This rad shares a bias for action and a commitment to empowering and encouraging potential legal engineers. Exceptions should be on the basis of serious ethical or moral concerns, not disagreements. Do-ers should keep in mind the best interests of LexDOA as a whole and consult with community members when those interests are not clear.
legal: LexDAO is a separate judicial identity to the members, and liability is limited to the personal tokens committed by mentors.

# PARTICIPANTS
mentor: A mentor is anyone who has minted personal tokens and committed them to the mentor-apprenticeship raid.
removal: If a mentor believes another mentor is not respecting the serious concerns of others, a proposal for review may be submitted to the council of rogues as town-hall meeting
roles:
limits: If a member exhibits disregard for others' serious concerns, then bylaws on suspension or even removal may be initiated.

# POLICY
rights: Mentors have a right to decide how they make their contributions **BEFORE** the program is scheduled, while other LexDAO members have the right to object on the basis of serious concerns.
decision: Individual members and mentors can decide what and how they want to contribute to the problem briefs, reasonably respecting the community's precedent and the expressed opinions of others.
implementation: As mutually agreed with the mentor directory being the discussion point.
oversight: If another LexDAO member holds serious ethical or moral concerns, that member can create a proposal stating clearly what actions should be prohibited.
