### Primary Issues to Hit:

These are the primary issues to hit with whatever deliverable we provide to the Select Committee with respect to the regulation of DAOs: 

* **Identity** - Whether membership in a "registered" DAO can be anonymous, pseudonymous, or requires an identity (could be company name / registration, or identity of a natural person. This also might need to be different for permissioned and non-permissioned DAOs. 


Scenario Identity


* **Entity Status** - Whether DAOs become a unique type of entity. This might be a more futuristic question, but we should decide whether we would want for DAOs to be able to register as some sort of unique type of entity a DLLC, DCorp, or just DAO. If so, we would want to think about the requirements for registration (i.e. name, original organizer, share value, etc). We might also want to consider whether a more flexible approach like having an LLC or Corp be operated as a DAO for accounting and governance purposes suffices. 




* **Size** - What is the maximum size for "registered" DAOs. This should probably depend on their corporate status. For example, a corporation or LLC must start filing 34 Act disclosures if the shareholder / membership numbers get over 2,000 (this is federal), so for-profit DAOs might need to be limited to under 2,000 (unless they go public), but we probably don't want them to have limited memberships beyond that (ala S-corp status). 




* **Securities** - Whether membership interests in a DAO default to a security under state law, and thus would require registration with the State or some sort of blue-sky exemption (e.g. 506 - Reg D offerings). We probably want to push for permissioned DAO shares to be exempt from any sort of definition of security, though, if we want to get more aggressive, could push for any DAO in which the members are required to participate in governance to be exempt from securities regulation (at least on the WY level). 




* **Liability** - Obviously want limited liability for DAO members, so that people could sue the DAO and not reach through to individual members. This might be difficult in the context of a mechanic like ragequit, but I think fraudulent transfer laws would protect people who have claims against a DAO from getting screwed by all of the DAO members rage quitting. 





* **Tax Treatment** - Need to consider tax treatment under state law. Probably goes back to the entity question, but if there's a unique entity for DAOs it would likely make sense for DAOs to be treated as pass-through entities. 





* **Agents / Contracting** - Might consider who can be considered an agent of a DAO. This again depends a lot on permissioned on unpermissioned, though one way around this would be to make it such that DAOs can only have temporary agents as designated in a passed proposal. Would want it clear that any proposal voted through by the membership according to the voting rules of that DAO can create a valid contractual relationship between the DAO and a third party, potentiall with the applicant or proposer given limited agent status for such transaction. 

* **Anti-Takeover** - Might want to consider whether there should be any anti-takeover provisions. It might be at least nice, especially for non-permissioned DAOs, that any persons and thier affiliates that acquire more than 20% of a DAO must make themselves know to the rest of the members. And maybe we should think about whether there should be some sort of tender offer rules / regs for non-permissioned DAOs, so that you can't buy just 51% of a DAO without offering to buy the minority DAO shareholder's shares on the same terms. Thinking more of a DAO that collects revenue from a project, so ragequitting might mean giving up your share of project revenues and leave you with an essentially worthless token. 

### Next Steps

* Determine what kind of deliverable the Cmte wants, a comment letter, model legislation with a policy paper, etc. 

* Try to recruit a few law students interested in this area to do research on equivilent statutueslike LLCs, BLLCs, Corps, etc and related case law to build a case for our perspectives. 

* Draft a document to circulate.

# Liability issues - where it starts might not be where it ends up.  
There is a confict of expectations that may lead for it to be broken,

Tokens is it functionaly equvalent?  

If it is not be need to make a new analysis is the problem with the code and can it be abstracted into the legal realism.


MakerDAO - Red Pool Blue Pool.
VC Control over the mutisig after the DAO was formed.  
How does the DAO move forward?

Lack of loyalty 


======================
### This is the rough pedagogy where
### Law student legislative overlay opportunity
 
1. Mentors devise rough plan of action
2. pairs collect caselaw data
3. they compare the functional equivalence (compare against  token mechanism)
4. Do a legal risk analysis to identify deficiencies in either smart contract, social process or (cumbersome) law
5. write up a new problem brief for the next round

### Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology & Digital Information Technology-PM


A TLDR summary of the 4.5-hour Task-Force  (minutes into video =)


![](https://i.imgur.com/9RQPFb6.jpg)

![](https://i.imgur.com/3bQNMZg.png)

#### Jurisdictional Concerns
- [11m](https://youtu.be/ASWzQoLqvWg?t=660) = digital identity (pluristic) and WY "residency" (no domicile test at moment) and application to "travel" rule (passport for mobile capital). 
      - Citation: 


#### Privacy Rights
- [25m](https://youtu.be/ASWzQoLqvWg?t=1500) = initial proposal for privacy rights xref Claire Sullivan (https://www.adelaide.edu.au/press/titles/digital-identity) starting from premise nobody compelled to share private key & evolving towards functional identity (rather than natural rights) which is defined around control aspects rather than ownership


#### Solving the Id problem with 0x Accounts      
- [37m](https://youtu.be/ASWzQoLqvWg?t=2250) = CA/NL/NZ moving towards decentralised ID ... (WY trying to avoid the route CN heading) ... use case or implemented "practices"? maybe in state filing


#### Continuing Education and Verifiable Identities
- [42m](https://youtu.be/ASWzQoLqvWg) - concern about (legal) continuing training which needs to be tied to natural person (not just agent, delegate, steward ... ) and possible abuse by authorities (cf Taiwan) whilst trying to attract custody banking service (talks with IBM/MS)


#### Connecting Identity to Verifiable Layers of Trust
-  [55m](https://youtu.be/ASWzQoLqvWg?t=3282) - deployment of digital self sovereignty via WY driver's license = existing ID trust anchor (weak tie) -> master avatar + credentials (offchain) = segregated data by design (8 keys) which is sorta a deterministic hierarchical wallet ... claims transaction analysis stops at the certifier (masked-out) which can be switched out (can be traced if certifier agrees)

- [1:01](https://youtu.be/ASWzQoLqvWg?t=3660) segmented data means expose just enough to verify ... eg proof of age on driverID cf one example mentioned turned into stalking by copying her address


#### The Anti-money-laundering Quandry 
- [1:28](https://youtu.be/ASWzQoLqvWg?t=5280) = headache about AML but talking with flexible solutions for local banks (not federal chartered) ... try to differentiate from other states. Catalin asked about non-banks ... answer most financial institutions and entry/exit points .. potential of weak links and thus ID theft as govt forced sensitive "data in motion" and 3rd party doctrine means data insecurity
  Third-party-doctrine: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-third-party-doctrine/282721/
    - Citation: 

#### Avoid the Taint when Accepting Altcoins
- [1:40m](https://youtu.be/ASWzQoLqvWg?t=6013) Financial Action Taskforce (not yet in US law) problem of "taint" in that if accept altcoins, a business is now responsible for obligations of travel rules. Consider a data "trust" with higher duties/oblgations
    - Citation: 

#### DAOs Improved Coordination Activities
- [2:05](https://youtu.be/ASWzQoLqvWg?t=7468) = DAOs as separate legal entity? (clarify law in traditional member's interest) Prof Aaron Wright prof in openlaw ... argue new ways to coordinate non-hierarchical activities. is WY becoming delaware of digital assets? Accepts DAO with no central boards/authority and member transparent in contributions (recorded in software, not enforced by legal strictures). 

#### Protecting Individuals while Not Displacing Fiduciary Responsibilities
- [2:22](https://youtu.be/ASWzQoLqvWg?t=8529) problems with LAOs in fixed operating agreement and waiving of fudiciary obligations ... more amorphous and reduce time/expense. DAOs designed to protect individuals ... reduce information asymmetries and decentralising controls
    - Citation: 

#### Can Registered Agent Rulse be Modernized?
- [2:29m](https://youtu.be/ASWzQoLqvWg?t=8948) should DAOs have a new form of registered agent? (eg membership list) potentially related to data-trust and pay taxes on behalf of escrow without being considered money-transmitter. But not easy/cheap as common caselaw is not collected in single place ... ($30k to train a lawyer up to speed on LAOs)
    - Citation: 


#### Paradigm Shift to Progammable Governance 
- [2:35m](https://youtu.be/ASWzQoLqvWg?t=9298) programable governance is not just money, is going to be ground-breaking ... opportunity to attract global participation. Impediments ... risk of securities implications, state/IRS reporting, rights attached to membership tokens. LLC statute has some defaults but can customise operating agreement and avoid ambiguity of natural language.
    - Citations:  https://www.irs.gov/government-entities/indian-tribal-governments/internal-revenue-code-sections
    - https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26


#### Internal Standing for Code - "Millenials" Demand 
- [2:50](https://youtu.be/ASWzQoLqvWg?t=10220) need meeting of minds in IP, supplanting fudiciary duties of board to members, community bylaws rather than formal legal recognition. Code via smart contracts has internal standing ... strong demand and searching for non-traditional form. Skeptics assert that if you seek a "corporate" shield, you have to give up something. Advocates note millenials want creative peer relationships and not the traditional hierarchy.


#### Member Token Locks as a Solution to Traceability Concerns 
- [3:08](https://youtu.be/ASWzQoLqvWg?t=11230) - formal legal entities have a certain acceptance, business confidence beyond nebulous non-structure. Catalin notes groups trying to follow rules (deference to software) rather than subjective human "managers". Existing lawyers are not comfortable with this as traceability disappears (when/if membership tokens are transferable). 


#### Using a Proper DAO as a Formally Recognized Operating Agreement
- [3:26](https://youtu.be/ASWzQoLqvWg?t=12410) - nature of org is written in code, then legal recognition (as fallback) is supplementary. Should code be "filed" as operating agreement? Fractionalisaton of value? Point is not the token per se, but how it is used makes it a security. Also, very little cash is typically involved but time ... to what point is value created from participation and be treated fairly

#### Folow Existing Wyoming State LLC Statutes 
- [3:45](https://youtu.be/ASWzQoLqvWg?t=13462) probably 95% of what emerging DAOs want is already in WY LLC statutes but just needs a good map. Policy decision of how to treat from liability perspective (piercing corporate veil). LLC-lite? LimPartnership++? What legal assumptions need to be discarded? Points out advantage of L3C (Low-profit limited liability company) as framework to draw tech firms. Quarantining participants' other assets ... (personal time to remedy?) 
    - Citation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-profit_limited_liability_company


#### LexDAO/LexxCorp as a First-Mover with Wyoming Legislature
- [4:03](https://youtu.be/ASWzQoLqvWg?t=14605) - want to use live case example (from PoV of lawyer). What are characteristic of DOA that need the 5% extra?  Narrow scope of discussions to reduce committee time. What has to be clarified? WY trying to be meaningful first mover in how web3 software needs to be packaged?


#### Public comments 
- [4:13](https://youtu.be/ASWzQoLqvWg?t=15175) Public comments + mismash 


#### Local Registered agents re-education 
- ... Registered local agent fundamental obstacle (lack of general awareness). 


#### Special Purpose Despository Institution (SPDI) Opportunities
Use of Special Purpose Despository Institution (SPDI) structure (pitch to state O&G industry) tokenised in underlying commodities business. 


#### Altcoins accepted as Payment for Legal Services - FINCEN Reporting Requirements Kick-In
Can local attorneys accept altcoins as payment? (write to bar for legal opinion) = one view is barter any commodity & property is perfectly acceptable & ethical (but 10k limit for FinCEN reporting).


#### Follow-up for LexGroups
Follow-up **LexDAO to consider submission on remaining 5% of legislation** https://discord.gg/gBfxAV on _#raid-smart-co_ channel after discussing with other DAOs what legal scaffolding they need.

Abstract

Credentials are a part of our daily lives; driver's licenses are used to assert that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle, university degrees can be used to assert our level of education, and government-issued passports enable us to travel between countries. This specification provides a mechanism to express these sorts of credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.

================= 

For those unfamiliar with the concepts related to verifiable credentials, the following sections provide an overview of:

    The components that constitute a verifiable credential
    The components that constitute a verifiable presentation
    An ecosystem where verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations are expected to be useful
    The use cases and requirements that informed this specificat

Most legal claims fall into three categories:
tort law, the USC or state codes, the UCC or trust law.

*** Trust law
documents can effectuate the transfer of most assets

Use Case:
Legal engineers get tokens, passed tokens to exchanges for other value.
it a rocognition system where you can get a legal engineering token.

Redeemed for cash but what happens when one 
quits, dies, transfers, break the law, become incapacitated or disappears?

If it is a unincorporated association it needs to be formalized in order to take advantage of state law protections and benefits.

Special Purpose Depository Institutions
HB 74 
---------------------------

http://wyomingbankingdivision.wyo.gov/home/areas-of-regulation/laws-and-regulation/special-purpose-depository-institution

In 2019, the Wyoming Legislature enacted HB 74 which authorized the chartering of special purpose depository institutions (SPDIs). These institutions are banks that receive deposits and conduct other incidental activities, including fiduciary asset management, custody and related activities. It is likely that many SPDIs will focus heavily on digital assets, such as virtual currencies, digital securities and utility tokens. SPDIs may focus on traditional assets as well. 

SPDIs may resemble custody banks in that these institutions will likely focus on fiduciary activities, safekeeping, asset management and servicing. The role of a custody bank is focused on storing assets, fiduciary management, conducting a variety of transactions with assets and providing an 'on/off' ramp to securities markets, commodities markets and customer bank accounts.


SPDIs also may serve as a vehicle for business cash management, operational accounts, and any other purpose permitted by HB 74.
