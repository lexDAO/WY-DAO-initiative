### Primary Issues to Hit:

These are the primary issues to hit with whatever deliverable we provide to the Select Committee with respect to the regulation of DAOs: 

* **Identity** - Whether membership in a "registered" DAO can be anonymous, pseudonymous, or requires an identity (could be company name / registration, or identity of a natural person. This also might need to be different for permissioned and non-permissioned DAOs. 


Scenario Identity


* **Entity Status** - Whether DAOs become a unique type of entity. This might be a more futuristic question, but we should decide whether we would want for DAOs to be able to register as some sort of unique type of entity a DLLC, DCorp, or just DAO. If so, we would want to think about the requirements for registration (i.e. name, original organizer, share value, etc). We might also want to consider whether a more flexible approach like having an LLC or Corp be operated as a DAO for accounting and governance purposes suffices. 




* **Size** - What is the maximum size for "registered" DAOs. This should probably depend on their corporate status. For example, a corporation or LLC must start filing 34 Act disclosures if the shareholder / membership numbers get over 2,000 (this is federal), so for-profit DAOs might need to be limited to under 2,000 (unless they go public), but we probably don't want them to have limited memberships beyond that (ala S-corp status). 




* **Securities** - Whether membership interests in a DAO default to a security under state law, and thus would require registration with the State or some sort of blue-sky exemption (e.g. 506 - Reg D offerings). We probably want to push for permissioned DAO shares to be exempt from any sort of definition of security, though, if we want to get more aggressive, could push for any DAO in which the members are required to participate in governance to be exempt from securities regulation (at least on the WY level). 




* **Liability** - Obviously want limited liability for DAO members, so that people could sue the DAO and not reach through to individual members. This might be difficult in the context of a mechanic like ragequit, but I think fraudulent transfer laws would protect people who have claims against a DAO from getting screwed by all of the DAO members rage quitting. 





* **Tax Treatment** - Need to consider tax treatment under state law. Probably goes back to the entity question, but if there's a unique entity for DAOs it would likely make sense for DAOs to be treated as pass-through entities. 





* **Agents / Contracting** - Might consider who can be considered an agent of a DAO. This again depends a lot on permissioned on unpermissioned, though one way around this would be to make it such that DAOs can only have temporary agents as designated in a passed proposal. Would want it clear that any proposal voted through by the membership according to the voting rules of that DAO can create a valid contractual relationship between the DAO and a third party, potentiall with the applicant or proposer given limited agent status for such transaction. 

* **Anti-Takeover** - Might want to consider whether there should be any anti-takeover provisions. It might be at least nice, especially for non-permissioned DAOs, that any persons and thier affiliates that acquire more than 20% of a DAO must make themselves know to the rest of the members. And maybe we should think about whether there should be some sort of tender offer rules / regs for non-permissioned DAOs, so that you can't buy just 51% of a DAO without offering to buy the minority DAO shareholder's shares on the same terms. Thinking more of a DAO that collects revenue from a project, so ragequitting might mean giving up your share of project revenues and leave you with an essentially worthless token. 

### Next Steps

* Determine what kind of deliverable the Cmte wants, a comment letter, model legislation with a policy paper, etc. 

* Try to recruit a few law students interested in this area to do research on equivilent statutueslike LLCs, BLLCs, Corps, etc and related case law to build a case for our perspectives. 

* Draft a document to circulate.

Abstract

Credentials are a part of our daily lives; driver's licenses are used to assert that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle, university degrees can be used to assert our level of education, and government-issued passports enable us to travel between countries. This specification provides a mechanism to express these sorts of credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.

================= 

For those unfamiliar with the concepts related to verifiable credentials, the following sections provide an overview of:

    The components that constitute a verifiable credential
    The components that constitute a verifiable presentation
    An ecosystem where verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations are expected to be useful
    The use cases and requirements that informed this specificat

Are they going to be swappable and interchangeable?

Most legal claims fall into three categories:
tort law, the USC or state codes, the UCC or trust law.

*** Trust law

Legal engineers get tokens, passed tokens to exchanges for other value.
it a rocognition system where you can get a legal engineering token.

2) LexLocker - ADR and other custodial associations
3) LexToken a fungible - tokenized asset offering
4) LexKudos is a token for trading on system reputation.

If it is a unincorporated association it needs to be formalized in order to take advantage of state law protections and benefits.

"If we are not one of those" we need to look for a framework that makes sense.

We will need a registered agent, where the real property is, file some sort of memo with a secretarty state or county recorders office.

Special Purpose Depository Institutions
HB 74 
---------------------------

http://wyomingbankingdivision.wyo.gov/home/areas-of-regulation/laws-and-regulation/special-purpose-depository-institution

In 2019, the Wyoming Legislature enacted HB 74 which authorized the chartering of special purpose depository institutions (SPDIs). These institutions are banks that receive deposits and conduct other incidental activities, including fiduciary asset management, custody and related activities. It is likely that many SPDIs will focus heavily on digital assets, such as virtual currencies, digital securities and utility tokens. SPDIs may focus on traditional assets as well. 

SPDIs may resemble custody banks in that these institutions will likely focus on fiduciary activities, safekeeping, asset management and servicing. The role of a custody bank is focused on storing assets, fiduciary management, conducting a variety of transactions with assets and providing an 'on/off' ramp to securities markets, commodities markets and customer bank accounts.


SPDIs also may serve as a vehicle for business cash management, operational accounts, and any other purpose permitted by HB 74.
